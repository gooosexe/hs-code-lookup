    <h2>Notes.</h2>
    <p>1. This Chapter does not cover:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
      <li>(a) Sugar confectionery containing cocoa (heading 18.06);</li>
      <li>(b) Chemically pure sugars (other than sucrose, lactose, maltose, glucose and fructose) or other products of heading 29.40; or </li>
      <li>(c) Medicaments or other products of Chapter 30.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Subheading  Notes.</strong></p>
    <p>1. For the purpose of subheading 1701.12, 1701.13 and 1701.14, &quot;raw sugar&quot; means sugar whose content of sucrose by weight, in the dry state, corresponds to a polarimeter reading of less than 99.5°.</p>
    <p>2. Subheading 1701.13 covers only cane sugar obtained without centrifugation, whose content of sucrose by weight, in the dry state, corresponds to a polarimeter reading of 69° or more but less than 93°. The product contains only natural anhedral microcrystals, of irregular shape, not visible to the naked eye, which are surrounded by residues of molasses and other constituents of sugar cane.</p>
