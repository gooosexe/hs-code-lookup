    <h2>Notes.</h2>
    <p>1. Throughout the Nomenclature the expression  &quot;plastics&quot; means those materials of headings 39.01 to 39.14 which are  or have been capable, either at the moment of polymerisation or at some  subsequent stage, of being formed under external influence (usually heat and  pressure, if necessary with a solvent or plasticiser) by moulding, casting,  extruding, rolling or other process into shapes which are retained on the  removal of the external influence.</p>
    <p>Throughout the Nomenclature any reference to  &quot;plastics&quot; also includes vulcanised fibre. The expression, however,  does not apply to materials regarded as textile materials of Section XI.</p>
    <p>2. This  Chapter does not cover:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
      <li>(a) Lubricating preparations  of heading 27.10 or 34.03;</li>
      <li>(b) Waxes of heading 27.12 or  34.04;</li>
      <li>(c) Separate chemically  defined organic compounds (Chapter 29);</li>
      <li>(d) Heparin or its salts  (heading 30.01);</li>
      <li>(e) Solutions (other than collodions) consisting of any  of the products specified in headings 39.01 to 39.13 in volatile organic  solvents when the weight of the solvent exceeds 50% of the weight of the  solution (heading 32.08); stamping foils of heading 32.12;</li>

      <li>(k) Diagnostic or laboratory  reagents on a backing of plastics (heading 38.22);</li>
      <li>(l) Synthetic rubber, as  defined for the purpose of Chapter 40, or articles thereof;</li>
      <li>(m) Saddlery or harness  (heading 42.01) or trunks, suitcases, handbags or other containers of heading  42.02;</li>
      <li>(n) Plaits, wickerwork or  other articles of Chapter 46;</li>
      <li>(o) Wall coverings of heading  48.14;</li>
      <li>(p) Goods of Section XI  (textiles and textile articles);</li>
      <li>(q)  Articles of Section XII (for example, footwear, headgear, umbrellas, sun  umbrellas, walking-sticks, whips, riding-crops or parts thereof);</li>
      <li>(r) Imitation jewellery of heading 71.17;</li>

      <li>(t) Parts of aircraft or vehicles of Section XVII;</li>
      <li>(u) Articles of Chapter 90 (for example, optical  elements, spectacle frames, drawing instruments);</li>
      <li>(v) Articles of Chapter 91 (for example, clock or watch  cases);</li>
      <li>(w) Articles of Chapter 92 (for example, musical  instruments or parts thereof);</li>
      <li>(x) Articles of Chapter 94 (for example, furniture, luminaires and lighting fittings, illuminated signs, prefabricated buildings);</li>
      <li>(y) Articles of Chapter 95 (for example, toys, games,  sports requisites); or</li>
      <li>(z) Articles of Chapter 96 (for example, brushes, buttons, slide fasteners, combs, mouthpieces or stems for smoking pipes, cigarette-holders or the like, parts of vacuum flasks or the like, pens, propelling pencils, and monopods, bipods, tripods and similar articles).</li>
    </ul>
    <p> 3. Headings 39.01 to 39.11 apply only to goods  of a kind produced by chemical synthesis, falling in the following categories:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
      <li>(a) Liquid synthetic polyolefins of which less than 60%  by volume distils at 300°C, after conversion to 1,013 millibars when a  reduced-pressure distillation method is used (headings 39.01 and 39.02);</li>
      <li>(b) Resins, not highly  polymerised, of the coumarone-indene type (heading 39.11);</li>
      <li>(c) Other synthetic polymers  with an average of at least 5 monomer units;</li>
      <li>(d) Silicones (heading  39.10);</li>
      <li>(e) Resols (heading 39.09)  and other prepolymers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>4. The expression &quot;copolymers&quot; covers all  polymers in which no single monomer unit contributes 95% or more by weight to  the total polymer content.</p>
    <p>For the purpose of this Chapter, except where the  context otherwise requires, copolymers (including co-polycondensates, co-polyaddition  products, block copolymers and graft copolymers) and polymer blends are to be  classified in the heading covering polymers of that comonomer unit which  predominates by weight over every other single comonomer unit. For the purposes  of this Note, constituent comonomer units of polymers falling in the same  heading shall be taken together.</p>
    <p>If no single comonomer unit predominates, copolymers,  or polymer blends, as the case may be, are to be classified in the heading  which occurs last in numerical order among those which equally merit  consideration.</p>
    <p>5. Chemically modified polymers, that is those in which  only appendages to the main polymer chain have been changed by chemical  reaction, are to be classified in the heading appropriate to the unmodified  polymer. This provision does not apply to graft copolymers.</p>
    <p>6. In headings 39.01 to  39.14, the expression &quot;primary forms&quot; applies only to the following  forms:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
      <li>(a) Liquids and pastes,  including dispersions (emulsions and suspensions) and solutions;</li>
      <li>(b) Blocks of irregular  shape, lumps, powders (including moulding powders), granules, flakes and  similar bulk forms.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>7. Heading 39.15 does not apply to waste, parings and  scrap of a single thermoplastic material, transformed into primary forms  (headings 39.01 to 39.14).</p>
    <p>8. For the purpose of heading 39.17, the expression  &quot;tubes, pipes and hoses&quot; means hollow products, whether  semi-manufactures or finished products, of a kind generally used for conveying,  conducting or distributing gases or liquids (for example, ribbed garden hose,  perforated tubes). This expression also includes sausage casings and other  lay-flat tubing. However, except for the last-mentioned, those having an internal  cross-section other than round, oval, rectangular (in which the length does not  exceed 1.5 times the width) or in the shape of a regular polygon are not to be  regarded as tubes, pipes and hoses but as profile shapes.</p>
    <p>9. For the purpose of heading 39.18, the expression  &quot;wall or ceiling coverings of plastics&quot; applies to products in rolls,  of a width not less than 45 cm, suitable for wall or ceiling decoration,  consisting of plastics fixed permanently on a backing of any material other  than paper, the layer of plastics (on the face side) being grained, embossed,  coloured, design-printed or otherwise decorated.</p>
    <p>10. In headings 39.20 and 39.21, the expression  &quot;plates, sheets, film, foil and strip&quot; applies only to plates, sheets,  film, foil and strip (other than those of Chapter 54) and to blocks of regular  geometric shape, whether or not printed or otherwise surface-worked, uncut or  cut into rectangles (including squares) but not further worked (even if when so  cut they become articles ready for use).</p>
    <p>11. Heading 39.25 applies only to the following  articles, not being products covered by any of the earlier headings of  sub-Chapter&nbsp;II:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
      <li>(a) Reservoirs, tanks  (including septic tanks), vats and similar containers, of a capacity exceeding  300 litres;</li>
      <li>(b) Structural elements used,  for example, in floors, walls or partitions, ceilings or roofs;</li>
      <li>(c) Gutters and fittings  therefor;</li>
      <li>(d) Doors, windows and their  frames and thresholds for doors;</li>
      <li>(e) Balconies, balustrades,  fencing, gates and similar barriers;</li>
      <li>(f) Shutters, blinds  (including Venetian blinds) and similar articles and parts and fittings  thereof;</li>
      <li>(g) Large-scale shelving for assembly and  permanent installation, for example, in shops, workshops, warehouses;</li>
      <li>(h) Ornamental architectural  features, for example, flutings, cupolas, dovecotes; and</li>
      <li>(ij) Fittings and mountings intended for permanent  installation in or on doors, windows, staircases, walls or other parts of  buildings, for example, knobs, handles, hooks, brackets, towel rails,  switch-plates and other protective plates.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Subheading Notes.    </h2>
    <p>1. Within any one heading of this Chapter, polymers  (including copolymers) and chemically modified polymers are to be classified  according to the following provisions:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
      <li>(a) Where there is a  subheading named &quot;Other&quot; in the same series:
        <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
          <li>(1) The designation in a subheading of a polymer by the  prefix &quot;poly&quot; (for example, polyethylene and polyamide-6,6) means  that the constituent monomer unit or monomer units of the named polymer taken  together must contribute 95% or more by weight of the total polymer content.</li>
          <li>(2) The copolymers named in subheadings 3901.30, 3901.40, 3903.20, 3903.30 and 3904.30 are to be classified in those subheadings, provided that the comonomer units of the named copolymers contribute 95% or more by weight of the total polymer content.</li>
          <li>(3) Chemically modified polymers are to be classified  in the subheading named &quot;Other&quot;, provided that the chemically modified  polymers are not more specifically covered by another subheading.</li>
          <li>(4) Polymers not meeting (1), (2) or (3) above, are to  be classified in the subheading, among the remaining subheadings in the series,  covering polymers of that monomer unit which predominates by weight over every  other single comonomer unit. For this purpose, constituent monomer units of  polymers falling in the same subheading shall be taken together. Only the  constituent comonomer units of the polymers in the series of subheadings under  consideration are to be compared.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>(b) Where there is no  subheading named &quot;Other&quot; in the same series:
        <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
          <li>(1) Polymers are to be classified in the subheading  covering polymers of that monomer unit which predominates by weight over every  other single comonomer unit. For this purpose, constituent monomer units of  polymers falling in the same subheading shall be taken together. Only the  constituent comonomer units of the polymers in the series under consideration  are to be compared.</li>
          <li>(2) Chemically modified polymers are to be classified  in the subheading appropriate to the unmodified polymer.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Polymer blends are to be classified in the same  subheading as polymers of the same monomer units in the same proportions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>2. For the purposes of subheading 3920.43, the term  &quot;plasticizers&quot; includes secondary plasticizers.</p>
    <h2>Supplementary Notes.    </h2>
    <p>1. Notes 4 and 5 of this Chapter apply, <em>mutatis  mutandis</em>, to all of the tariff items of this Chapter, other than those  where the seventh and eighth digits are &quot;00&quot;.</p>
    <p>2. (a) For the purpose of classification within any one  subheading of this Chapter, the expression &quot;composition&quot; means only  those polymers, copolymers, polymer blends and chemically modified polymers  containing non-polymeric substances such as:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
      <li>(i) initiators, activators  and catalysts, to assist in the action or use of the polymeric substances in  some intended process;</li>
      <li>(ii) colourants; or</li>
      <li>(iii) fillers, reinforcing agents, solvents, fire  retardants, plasticizers and similar additives, present in amounts generally  more than 1% by weight.</li>
    </ul>
<p>(b) The presence of any or combinations of the  following, without the presence of other non-polymeric substances specified in  paragraph (a) above, shall not render a material a composition:
</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
  <li>(i) manufacturing impurities,  1% or less, by weight;</li>
  <li>(ii) manufacturing impurities, more than 1% weight,  provided the impurities do not contribute beneficially to the subsequent  processing or performance of the polymeric material;</li>
  <li> (iii) stabilizers  such as antioxidants, process aids and similar special-purpose additives,  present in small amounts, generally less than 1% weight;</li>
  <li>(iv) anti-caking agents;</li>
  <li>(v) water; or</li>
  <li>(vi) in aqueous dispersions or solutions, the  emulsifiers, stabilizers and other agents used to maintain the dispersion or  solution form.</li>
