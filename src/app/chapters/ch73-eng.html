    <h2>Notes.</h2>
    <p>1. In this Chapter the expression &quot;cast iron&quot; applies  to products obtained by casting in which iron predominates by weight over each  of the other elements and which do not comply with the chemical composition of  steel as defined in Note 1 (d) to Chapter 72.    </p>
    <p>2. In this Chapter the word &quot;wire&quot; means hot or cold-formed  products of any cross-sectional shape, of which no cross-sectional dimension  exceeds 16 mm.</p>

    <h2>Statistical Note. </h2>
    <p>(NB This note does not form part of the Customs Tariff legislation.)</p>
    <p>1.	For the statistical purposes of classification No. 7323.94.00.91, the description “subject to custom duty based on excise duty” means the items classified within this classification number contain an excisable good such as alcohol or tobacco, when being imported</p>
