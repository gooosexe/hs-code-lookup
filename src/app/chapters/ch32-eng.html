      <li>(b) Tannates or other tannin derivatives of products of headings  29.36 to 29.39, 29.41 or 35.01 to 35.04; or</li>

    <p>2. Heading 32.04 includes mixtures of stabilised diazonium salts  and couplers for the production of azo dyes.</p>
    <p>3. Headings 32.03, 32.04, 32.05 and 32.06 apply also to preparations  based on colouring matter (including, in the case of heading 32.06, colouring  pigments of heading 25.30 or Chapter 28, metal flakes and metal powders), of a  kind used for colouring any material or used as ingredients in the manufacture  of colouring preparations. The headings do not apply, however, to pigments  dispersed in non-aqueous media, in liquid or paste form, of a kind used in the  manufacture of paints, including enamels (heading 32.12), or to other  preparations of heading 32.07, 32.08, 32.09, 32.10, 32.12, 32.13 or 32.15.</p>

    <p>5. The expression &quot;colouring matter&quot; in this Chapter  does not include products of a kind used as extenders in oil paints, whether or  not they are also suitable for colouring distempers.</p>
    <p>6. The expression &quot;stamping foils&quot; in heading 32.12  applies only to thin sheets of a kind used for printing, for example, book  covers or hat bands, and consisting of:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
