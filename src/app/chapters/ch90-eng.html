    </ul>
    <p>2. Subject to Note 1 above, parts and accessories for machines,  apparatus, instruments or articles of this Chapter are to be classified  according to the following rules:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
      <li>(a) Parts and accessories which are goods included in any of the  headings of this Chapter or of Chapter 84, 85 or 91 (other than heading 84.87,  85.48 or 90.33) are in all cases to be classified in their respective headings;</li>
      <li>(b) Other parts and accessories, if suitable for use solely or  principally with a particular kind of machine, instrument or apparatus, or with  a number of machines, instruments or apparatus of the same heading (including a  machine, instrument or apparatus of heading 90.10, 90.13 or 90.31) are to be  classified with the machines, instruments or apparatus of that kind; </li>
      <li>(c) All other parts and accessories are to be classified in  heading 90.33.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>3. The provisions of Notes 3 and 4 to Section XVI apply also to  this Chapter.</p>
    <p>4. Heading 90.05 does not apply to telescopic sights for fitting  to arms, periscopic telescopes for fitting to submarines or tanks, or to  telescopes for machines, appliances, instruments or apparatus of this Chapter  or Section XVI; such telescopic sights and telescopes are to be classified in  heading 90.13.</p>
    <p>5. Measuring or checking optical instruments, appliances or  machines which, but for this Note, could be classified both in heading 90.13  and in heading 90.31 are to be classified in heading 90.31.</p>
    <p>6. For the purposes of heading 90.21, the expression  &quot;orthopaedic appliances&quot; means appliances for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Preventing or correcting bodily deformities; or</li>
      <li>Supporting or holding parts of the body following an illness,  operation or injury.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Orthopaedic appliances include footwear and special insoles  designed to correct orthopaedic conditions, provided that they are either (1)  made to measure or (2) mass-produced, presented singly and not in pairs and  designed to fit either foot equally.</p>
    <p>7. Heading 90.32 applies only to:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
      <li>(a) Instruments and apparatus for automatically controlling the  flow, level, pressure or other variables of liquids or gases, or for  automatically controlling temperature, whether or not their operation depends  on an electrical phenomenon which varies according to the factor to be  automatically controlled, which are designed to bring this factor to, and  maintain it at, a desired value, stabilised against disturbances, by constantly  or periodically measuring its actual value; and</li>
      <li>(b) Automatic regulators of electrical quantities, and  instruments or apparatus for automatically controlling non-electrical  quantities the operation of which depends on an electrical phenomenon varying  according to the factor to be controlled, which are designed to bring this  factor to, and maintain it at, a desired value, stabilised against  disturbances, by constantly or periodically measuring its actural value.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Supplementary Notes.    </h2>
    <p>1. For the purpose of this Chapter, the term &quot;printed  circuit assembly&quot; means a good consisting of one or more printed circuits  of heading 85.34 with one or more active elements assembled thereon, with or  without passive elements. For the purpose of this Note, &quot;active  elements&quot; means diodes, transistors and similar semiconductor devices,  whether or not photosensitive, of heading 85.41, and integrated circuits and  microassemblies of heading 85.42.</p>
    <p>2. For the purpose of the tariff items of this Chapter, the term  &quot;electrical&quot; when used in reference to instruments, appliances,  apparatus and machines, refers to those articles the operation of which depends  on an electrical phenomenon which varies according to the factor to be  determined.</p>
    <h2>Statistical Note. </h2>
    <p>(NB This note does not form part of the Customs Tariff legislation.)</p>
    <p>1. For the statistical purposes of subheading 9001.10 having unit of measure &quot;metre&quot;, the intention is to capture the total number of metres obtained by multiplying the number of individual fibres by the length.</p>
