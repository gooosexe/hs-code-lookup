<p>8.	For the purpose of heading 85.34 “printed circuits” are circuits obtained by forming on an insulating base, by any printing process (for example, embossing, plating-up, etching) or by the “film circuit” technique, conductor elements, contacts or other printed components (for example, inductances, resistors, capacitors) alone or interconnected according to a pre-established pattern, other than elements which can produce, rectify, modulate or amplify an electrical signal (for example, semiconductor elements).</p>

<p>The expression “printed circuits” does not cover circuits combined with elements other than those obtained during the printing  process, nor does it cover individual, discrete resistors, capacitors or inductances. Printedcircuits may, however, be fitted with non-printed connecting elements.</p>
