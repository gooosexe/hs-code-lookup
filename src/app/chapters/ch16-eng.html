		<p><a href="/trade-commerce/tariff-tarif/2025/01-99/ch16-2025-eng.pdf">PDF (652 KB)</a>&nbsp;[<a href="/help-aide/dimf-dodf-eng.html">help with PDF files</a>]</p>
    <h2>Notes.    </h2>
    <p>1.	This Chapter does not cover meat, meat offal, fish, crustaceans, molluscs or other aquatic invertebrates, as well as insects,  prepared or preserved by the processes specified in Chapter 2 or 3, Note 6 to Chapter 4 or in heading 05.04.</p>

	<p>2.	Food preparations fall in this Chapter provided that they contain more than 20% by weight of sausage, meat, meat offal,  blood, insects, fish or crustaceans, molluscs or other aquatic invertebrates, or any combination thereof. In cases where the preparation contains two or more of the products mentioned above, it is classified in the heading of Chapter 16 corresponding to the component or components which predominate by weight. These provisions do not apply to the stuffed products of heading 19.02 or to the preparations of heading 21.03 or 21.04.</p>

    <h2>Subheading Notes.</h2>
    <p>1. For the purposes of subheading 1602.10, the expression “homogenized preparations” means preparations of meat, meat  offal, blood or insects, finely homogenised, put up for retail sale as food suitable for infants or young children or for dietetic purposes, in containers of a net weight content not exceeding 250 g. For the application of this definition no account is to be taken of small quantities of any ingredients which may have been added to the preparation for seasoning, preservation or other purposes. These preparations may contain a small quantity of visible pieces of meat, meat offal or insects. This subheading takes precedence over all other subheadings of heading 16.02.</p>
    <p>2. The fish, crustaceans, molluscs and other aquatic invertebrates specified in the subheadings of heading 16.04 or 16.05 under their common names only, are of the same species as those mentioned in Chapter 3 under the same name.</p>
    <h2>Supplementary Notes.</h2>
    <p>1. “Specially defined mixtures” of tariff item Nos. 1602.31.11, 1602.31.92, 1602.32.11 and 1602.32.92 means a product containing partially or fully cooked, including par-fried, chicken or turkey where 13% or more of the total weight of the product is comprised of goods other than the following listed goods: chicken, turkey, breading, batter, oil, glazing, sauces, other coatings or bastes, or any added water (including that used in marination, glazing, sauces, other coatings, bastes, breading or batter). For the purposes of this definition, whether 13% or more of the total weight of the product is comprised of goods other than the listed goods shall be determined by calculating the total weight of listed goods contained in that product as a percentage of the total weight of the product.</p>
    <p>2. Where the components of food preparations of a type used commercially in the preparation of fresh food products for direct sale to a consumer include cheese, those components are to be classified separately, in their respective headings, regardless of their packaging.</p>
    <h2>Statistical Note.</h2>
    <p>(NB this note does not form part of the Customs Tariff legislation.)</p>
    <p>1. For the statistical purposes of classification No. 1602.50.91.20, the expression &ldquo;corned beef&rdquo; applies to salted cured beef, with or without the addition of flavoring or spices.</p>
