    <h2>Notes.</h2>
    <p>1. For the purposes of this Chapter, the term &quot;leather&quot; includes  chamois (including combination chamois) leather, patent leather, patent  laminated leather and metalized leather.</p>
    <p>2. This Chapter does not cover:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
      <li>(a) Sterile surgical catgut or similar sterile suture materials  (heading 30.06);</li>
      <li>(b) Articles of apparel or clothing accessories (except gloves,  mittens and mitts), lined with furskin or artificial fur or to which furskin or  artificial fur is attached on the outside except as mere trimming (heading  43.03 or 43.04);</li>
      <li>(c) Made up articles of netting (heading 56.08);</li>
      <li>(d) Articles of Chapter 64;</li>

    </ul>
    <p>3. (A) In addition to the provisions of Note 2 above, heading  42.02 does not cover:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
      <li>(a) Bags made of sheeting of plastics, whether or not printed,  with handles, not designed for prolonged use (heading 39.23);</li>
      <li>(b) Articles of plaiting materials (heading 46.02).</li>

    <p>(B) Articles of headings 42.02 and 42.03 which have parts of  precious metal or metal clad with precious metal, of natural or cultured  pearls, of precious or semi-precious stones (natural, synthetic or  reconstructed) remain classified in those headings even if such parts  constitute more than minor fittings or minor ornamentation, provided that these  parts do not give the articles their essential character. If, on the other  hand, the parts give the articles their essential character, the articles are  to be classified in Chapter 71.</p>
    <p>4. For the purpose of heading 42.03, the expression  &quot;articles of apparel and clothing accessories&quot; applies, <em>inter alia</em>,  to gloves, mittens and mitts (including those for sport or for protection),  aprons and other protective clothing, braces, belts, bandoliers and wrist  straps, but excluding watch straps (heading 91.13). </p>
    <h2>Statistical Note.</h2> 
    <p>(NB This note does not form part of the Customs Tariff legislation.)</p>
    <p>1.	For the statistical purposes of classification Nos. 4202.32.10.21 and 4202.32.90.21, the description “subject to custom duty based on excise duty” means the items classified within these classification numbers contain an excisable good such as alcohol or tobacco, when being imported.</p>
