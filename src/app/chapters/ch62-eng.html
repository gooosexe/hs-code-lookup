    <h2>Notes.</h2>
    <p>1. This Chapter applies only to made up articles of any textile  fabric other than wadding, excluding knitted or crocheted articles (other than  those of heading 62.12).</p>
    <p>2. This Chapter does not cover:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
      <li>(a) Worn clothing or other worn articles of heading 63.09; or</li>
      <li>(b) Orthopaedic appliances, surgical belts, trusses or the like  (heading 90.21).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>3. For the purposes of heading 62.03 and 62.04:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
      <li>(a) The term &quot;suit&quot; means a set of garments composed  of two or three pieces made up, in respect of their outer surface, in identical  fabric and comprising:
        <ul>
          <li>one suit coat or jacket the outer shell of which, exclusive of  sleeves, consists of four or more panels, designed to cover the upper part of  the body, possibly with a tailored waistcoat in addition whose front is made  from the same fabric as the outer surface of the other components of the set and  whose back is made from the same fabric as the lining of the suit coat or  jacket; and</li>
          <li> one garment designed to cover the lower part of the body and  consisting of trousers, breeches or shorts (other than swimwear), a skirt or a  divided skirt, having neither braces nor bibs.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>All of the components of a &quot;suit&quot; must be of the same  fabric construction, colour and composition; they must also be of the same  style and of corresponding or compatible size. However, these components may  have piping (a strip of fabric sewn into the seam) in a different fabric.</li>
      <li>If several separate components to cover the lower part of the  body are presented together (for example, two pairs of trousers or trousers and  shorts, or a skirt or divided skirt and trousers), the constituent lower part  shall be one pair of trousers or, in the case of women's or girls' suits, the  skirt or divided skirt, the other garments being considered separately.</li>
      <li>The term &quot;suit&quot; includes the following sets of  garments, whether or not they fulfil all the above conditions:
        <ul>
          <li>morning dress, comprising a plain jacket (cutaway) with  rounded tails hanging well down at the back and striped trousers;</li>
          <li>evening dress (tailcoat), generally made of black cloth, the  jacket of which is relatively short at the front, does not close and has narrow  skirts cut in at the hips and hanging down behind;</li>
          <li>dinner jacket suits, in which the jacket is similar in style  to an ordinary jacket (though perhaps revealing more of the shirt front), but  has shiny silk or imitation silk lapels.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>(b) The term &quot;ensemble&quot; means a set of garments (other  than suits and articles of heading 62.07 or 62.08) composed of several pieces  made up in identical fabric, put up for retail sale, and comprising:
        <ul>
          <li>one garment designed to cover the upper part of the body with  the exception of waistcoats which may also form a second upper garment, and</li>
          <li>one or two different garments, designed to cover the lower  part of the body and consisting of trousers, bib and brace overalls, breeches,  shorts (other than swimwear), a skirt or a divided skirt.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>All of the components of an ensemble must be of the same fabric  construction, style, colour and composition; they also must be of corresponding  or compatible size. The term &quot;ensemble&quot; does not apply to track suits  or ski suits, of heading 62.11.</li>
    </ul>
	<p>4.	Headings 62.05 and 62.06 do not cover garments with pockets below the waist, with a ribbed waistband or other means of  tightening at the bottom of the garment. Heading 62.05 does not cover sleeveless garments.</p>

	<p>“Shirts” and “shirt-blouses” are garments designed to cover the upper part of the body, having long or short sleeves and a  full or partial opening starting at the neckline. “Blouses” are loose-fitting garments also designed to cover the upper part of the body but may be sleeveless and with or without an opening at the neckline. “Shirts”, “shirt-blouses” and “blouses” may also have a collar.</p>

    <p>5. For the purpose of heading 62.09:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
      <li>(a) The expression &quot;babies' garments and clothing accessories&quot;  means articles for young children of a body height not exceeding 86 cm</li>
      <li>(b) Articles which are, <em>prima facie</em>, classifiable both in  heading 62.09 and in other headings of this Chapter are to be classified in  heading 62.09.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>6. Garments which are, <em>prima facie</em>, classifiable both in  heading 62.10 and in other headings of this Chapter, excluding heading 62.09,  are to be classified in heading 62.10.</p>
    <p>7. For the purpose of heading 62.11, &quot;ski suits&quot; means  garments or sets of garments which, by their general appearance and texture,  are identifiable as intended to be worn principally for skiing (cross-country  or alpine). They consist either of:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
      <li>(a) a &quot;ski overall&quot;, that is, a one-piece garment  designed to cover the upper and the lower parts of the body; in addition to  sleeves and a collar the ski overall may have pockets or footstraps; or</li>
      <li>(b) a &quot;ski ensemble&quot;, that is, a set of garments  composed of two or three pieces, put up for retail sale and comprising:
        <ul>
          <li>one garment such as an anorak, wind-cheater, wind-jacket or  similar article, closed by a slide fastener (zipper), possibly with a waistcoat  in addition, and</li>
          <li>one pair of trousers whether or not extending above waist-level,  one pair of breeches or one bib and brace overall.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      </ul>
    <p>The &quot;ski ensemble&quot; may also consist of an overall  similar to the one mentioned in paragraph (a) above and a type of padded,  sleeveless jacket worn over the overall.</p>
    <p>All the components of a &quot;ski ensemble&quot; must be made up  in a fabric of the same texture, style and composition whether or not of the  same colour; they also must be of corresponding or compatible size.</p>
    <p>8. Scarves and articles of the scarf type, square or  approximately square, of which no side exceeds 60 cm, are to be classified as  handkerchiefs (heading 62.13). Handkerchiefs of which any side exceeds 60 cm  are to be classified in heading 62.14.</p>
    <p>9. Garments of this Chapter designed for left over right closure  at the front shall be regarded as men's or boys' garments, and those designed  for right over left closure at the front as women's or girls' garments. These  provisions do not apply where the cut of the garment clearly indicates that it  is designed for one or other of the sexes.</p>
    <p>Garments which cannot be identified as either men's or boys'  garments or as women's or girls' garments are to be classified in the headings  covering women's or girls' garments.</p>
    <p>10. Articles of this Chapter may be made of metal thread. </p>
