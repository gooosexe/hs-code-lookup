    </ul>
    <p>2. The articles (other than parts) referred to in headings 94.01  to 94.03 are to be classified in those headings only if they are designed for  placing on the floor or ground.</p>
    <p>The following are, however, to be classified in the above-mentioned  headings even if they are designed to be hung, to be fixed to the wall or to  stand one on the other:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
      <li>(a) Cupboards, bookcases, other shelved furniture (including  single shelves presented with supports for fixing them to the wall) and unit  furniture;</li>
      <li>(b) Seats and beds.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>3. (a) In headings 94.01 to 94.03 references to parts of goods  do not include references to sheets or slabs (whether or not cut to shape but  not combined with other parts) of glass (including mirrors), marble or other  stone or of any other material referred to in Chapter 68 or 69.</p>
    <p>(b) Goods described in heading 94.04, presented separately, are  not to be classified in heading 94.01, 94.02 or 94.03 as parts of goods.</p>
    <p>4.	For the purposes of heading 94.06, the expression "prefabricated buildings" means buildings which are finished in the factory  or put up as elements, presented together, to be assembled on site, such as housing or worksite accommodation, offices, schools, shops, sheds, garages or similar buildings.</p>
	<p>Prefabricated buildings include “modular building units” of steel, normally presented in the size and shape of a standard  shipping container, but substantially or completely pre-fitted internally. Such modular building units are normally designed to be assembled together to form permanent buildings.</p>
