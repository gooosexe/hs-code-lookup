    <h2>Notes.</h2>
    <p>1. The provisions of this Chapter are not subject to the rule  of specificity in General Interpretative Rule 3 (a). Goods which are described  in any provision of this Chapter are classifiable in said provision if the  conditions and requirements thereof and of any applicable regulations are met.</p>
    <p>2. Goods which may be classified under the provisions of  Chapter 99, if also eligible for classification under the provisions of Chapter  98, shall be classified in Chapter 98.</p>
    <p>3. For each tariff item of this  Chapter, the General Tariff rate is the Most-Favoured-Nation Tariff rate.</p>
    <p>4. For the purpose of this Chapter, &quot;duties&quot; means  duties or taxes levied or imposed on imported goods under Part 2 of this Act,  the <em>Excise Act, 2001</em> (other than section 54), the <em>Excise Tax Act</em>,  the <em>Special Import Measures Act</em> or any other Act of Parliament relating  to customs.</p>

    <h2>Subheading Notes.</h2>
    <p>1.  For the purpose of subheading 9804.20, the relief from payment of duties  granted shall not be combined with any relief from payment of duties granted  under subheading 9804.10 with respect to the same trip abroad.</p>
    <p>2. For the purpose of subheading 9804.40, the relief from  payment of duties granted shall be extended only to a person who, at time of  return to Canada, is not importing goods under another subheading of heading  98.04.</p>
