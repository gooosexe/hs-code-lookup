</ul>
<p>Flat-rolled products include those with patterns in relief  derived directly from rolling (for example, grooves, ribs, chequers, tears,  buttons, lozenges) and those which have been perforated, corrugated or  polished, provided that they do not thereby assume the character of articles or  products of other headings.</p>
<p>Flat-rolled products of a shape other than rectangular or  square, of any size, are to be classified as products of a width of 600 mm or  more, provided that they do not assume the character of articles or products of  other headings.</p>

These products may have indentations, ribs, grooves or  other deformations produced during the rolling process (reinforcing bars and  rods).</p>
<h3>(m) Other bars and rods
</h3>
<p>Products which do not conform to any of the definitions at (ij),  (k) or (l) above or to the definition of wire, which have a uniform solid  cross-section along their whole length in the shape of circles, segments of  circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), triangles or other convex  polygons (including &quot;flattened circles&quot; and &quot;modified  rectangles&quot;, of which two opposite sides are convex arcs, the other two  sides being straight, of equal length and parallel).

<ul>
  <li>have indentations, ribs, grooves or other deformations produced  during the rolling process (reinforcing bars and rods); </li>
  <li>be twisted after rolling.</li>
</ul>
<h3>(n) Angles, shapes and sections
</h3>
<p>Products having a uniform solid cross-section along their whole  length which do not conform to any of the definitions at (ij), (k), (l) or (m)  above or to the definition of wire.</p>
<p>Chapter 72 does not include products of heading 73.01 or 73.02.</p>
<h3>(o) Wire
</h3>
<p>Cold-formed products in coils, of any uniform solid cross-section  along their whole length, which do not conform to the definition of flat-rolled  products.</p>
<h3>(p) Hollow drill bars and rods
</h3>
<p>Hollow bars and rods of any cross-section, suitable for drills,  of which the greatest external dimension of the cross-section exceeds 15 mm but  does not exceed 52 mm, and of which the greatest internal dimension does not  exceed one half of the greatest external dimension. Hollow bars and rods of  iron or steel not conforming to this definition are to be classified in heading  73.04.</p>
<p>2. Ferrous metals clad with another ferrous metal are to be  classified as products of the ferrous metal predominating by weight.</p>
    <p>3. Iron or steel products obtained by electrolytic deposition,  by pressure casting or by sintering are to be classified, according to their  form, their composition and their appearance, in the headings of this Chapter  appropriate to similar hot-rolled products.</p>
    <h2>Subheading  Notes.</h2>
    <p>1. In this Chapter the following expressions have the meanings  hereby assigned to them:</p>
    <h3>(a) Alloy pig iron
    </h3>
    <p>Pig iron containing, by weight, one or more of the following  elements in the specified proportions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>more than 0.2% of chromium </li>
      <li>more than 0.3% of copper</li>
      <li>more than 0.3% of nickel </li>
      <li>more than 0.1% of any of the following elements: aluminum,  molybdenum, titanium, tungsten (wolfram), vanadium.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>(b) Non-alloy free-cutting steel
</h3>
    <p>Non-alloy steel containing, by weight, one or more of the  following elements in the specified proportions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>0.08% or more of sulphur </li>
      <li>0.1% or more of lead</li>
      <li>more than 0.05% of selenium </li>
      <li>more than 0.01% of tellurium</li>
      <li>more than 0.05% of bismuth. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>(c) Silicon-electrical steel
</h3>
    <p>Alloy steels containing by weight at least 0.6% but not more  than 6% of silicon and not more than 0.08% of carbon. They may also contain by  weight not more than 1% of aluminum but no other element in a proportion that  would give the steel the characteristics of another alloy steel.</p>
<h3>(d) High speed steel
</h3>
<p>Alloy steels containing, with or without other elements, at  least two of the three elements molybdenum, tungsten and vanadium with a  combined content by weight of 7% or more, 0.6% or more of carbon and 3 to 6% of  chromium.</p>
<h3>(e) Silico-manganese steel
</h3>
<p>Alloy steels containing by weight:</p>
<ul>
  <li>not more than 0.7% of carbon, </li>
  <li>0.5% or more but not more than 1.9% of manganese, and</li>
  <li>0.6% or more but not more than 2.3% of silicon, but no other  element in a proportion that would give the steel the characteristics of  another alloy steel. </li>
</ul>
<p>2. For the classification of ferro-alloys in the subheadings of  heading 72.02 the following rule should be observed:</p>
    <p>A ferro-alloy is considered as binary and classified under the  relevant subheading (if it exists) if only one of the alloy elements exceeds  the minimum percentage laid down in Chapter Note 1 (c); by analogy, it is  considered respectively as ternary or quaternary if two or three alloy elements  exceed the minimum percentage.</p>
    <p>For the application of this rule the unspecified &quot;other  elements&quot; referred to in Chapter Note 1 (c) must each exceed 10% by weight.</p>
<h2>Statistical Notes.  (NB These notes do not form part of the Customs Tariff legislation.)</h2> 

<p>1.	For the statistical purposes of subheadings 7222.11, 7222.19, 7222.20 and 7222.30, the expression "high nickel alloy steel" is considered to be nickel alloy steel containing by weight 24% or more of nickel.</p>

<p>2.	. For the statistical purposes of this Chapter, the expression “tire cord-quality steel wire rod” is considered to be rod  measuring 5.0 mm or more but not more than 6.0 mm in cross-sectional diameter, with an average partial decarburization of no more than 70 micrometers in depth (maximum 200 micrometers); having no non-deformable inclusions with a thickness (measured perpendicular to the rolling direction) greater than 20 micrometers; and, containing by weight the following elements in proportions:</p>
<ul>
<li>0.68% or more carbon,</li>
<li>less than 0.01% of aluminum,</li>
<li>0.04% or less, in aggregate, of phosphorus and sulfur,</li>
<li>0.008% or less of nitrogen, and</li>
<li>not more than 0.55% in the aggregate, of copper, nickel and chromium.</li>
</ul>

<p>3.	  For the statistical purposes of this Chapter, the expression “cold heading quality (CHQ)” is considered to be rod suitable for  cold heading, forging, or thread rolling, and meeting standard ASTM F2282.</p>
<p>4.	  For the statistical purposes of this Chapter, the expression “welding quality wire rod” is considered to be rod measuring less  than 10 mm in diameter having less than 0.2% carbon, less than 0.04% sulfur, and less than 0.04% phosphorus, suitable for drawing or rolling to final size for use as:</p>
<ul>
<li>an uncoated or plated or copper coated solid welding wire or rod;</li>
<li>the core wire or core rod for covered shielded metal arc (“SMAW”) welding electrode, or</li>
<li>the formed jacket of a flux cored welding electrode that is suitable for consumption in the electric arc welding process.</li>
</ul>
<p>5.	For the purposes of this Chapter, the term "concrete reinforcing bar", commonly known as rebar, means a steel bar produced with deformations.</p>
