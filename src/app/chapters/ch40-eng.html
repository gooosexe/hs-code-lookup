    <h2>Notes.</h2>
    <p>1. Except where the context otherwise requires, throughout the  Nomenclature the expression &quot;rubber&quot; means the following products,  whether or not vulcanised or hard: natural rubber, balata, gutta-percha,  guayule, chicle and similar natural gums, synthetic rubber, factice derived  from oils, and such substances reclaimed.</p>
    <p>2. This Chapter does not cover:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
      <li>(a) Goods of Section XI (textiles and textile articles);</li>
      <li>(b) Footwear or parts thereof of Chapter 64;</li>
      <li>(c) Headgear or parts thereof (including bathing caps) of  Chapter 65;</li>
      <li>(d) Mechanical or electrical appliances or parts thereof of  Section XVI (including electrical goods of all kinds), of hard rubber; </li>
      <li>(e) Articles of Chapter 90, 92, 94 or 96; or</li>
      <li>(f) Articles of Chapter 95 (other than sports gloves, mittens  and mitts and articles of headings 40.11 to 40.13).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>3. In headings 40.01 to 40.03 and 40.05, the expression  &quot;primary forms&quot; applies only to the following forms:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
      <li>(a) Liquids and pastes (including latex, whether or not pre-vulcanised,  and other dispersions and solutions);</li>
      <li>(b) Blocks of irregular shape, lumps, bales, powders, granules,  crumbs and similar bulk forms.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>4. In Note 1 to this Chapter and in heading 40.02, the  expression &quot;synthetic rubber&quot; applies to:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
      <li>(a) Unsaturated synthetic substances which can be irreversibly  transformed by vulcanisation with sulphur into non-thermoplastic substances  which, at a temperature between 18°C and 29°C, will not break on being extended  to three times their original length and will return, after being extended to  twice their original length, within a period of five minutes, to a length not  greater than one and a half times their original length. For the purpose of  this test, substances necessary for the cross-linking, such as vulcanising  activators or accelerators, may be added; the presence of substances as  provided for by Note 5 (B) (ii) and (iii) is also permitted. However, the  presence of any substances not necessary for the cross-linking, such as  extenders, plasticisers and fillers, is not permitted;</li>
      <li>(b) Thioplasts (TM); and</li>
      <li>(c) Natural rubber modified by grafting or mixing with  plastics, depolymerised natural rubber, mixtures of unsaturated synthetic  substances with saturated synthetic high polymers provided that all the above-mentioned  products comply with the requirements concerning vulcanisation, elongation and  recovery in (a) above.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>5. (A) Headings 40.01 and 40.02 do not apply to any rubber or  mixture of rubbers which has been compounded, before or after coagulation,  with:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
      <li>(i) vulcanising agents, accelerators, retarders or activators  (other than those added for the preparation of pre-vulcanised rubber latex);</li>
      <li>(ii) pigments or other colouring matter, other than those added  solely for the purpose of identification;</li>
      <li>(iii) plasticisers or extenders (except mineral oil in the case  of oil-extended rubber), fillers, reinforcing agents, organic solvents or any  other substances, except those permitted under (B);</li>
    </ul>
    <p>(B) The presence of the following substances in any rubber or  mixture of rubbers shall not affect its classification in heading 40.01 or  40.02, as the case may be, provided that such rubber or mixture of rubbers  retains its essential character as a raw material:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
      <li>(i) emulsifiers or anti-tack  agents; </li>
      <li>(ii) small amounts of  breakdown products of emulsifiers;</li>
      <li>(iii) very small amounts of the following: heat-sensitive agents  (generally for obtaining thermosensitive rubber latexes), cationic surface-active  agents (generally for obtaining electro-positive rubber latexes), antioxidants,  coagulants, crumbling agents, freeze-resisting agents, peptisers, preservatives,  stabilisers, viscosity-control agents, or similar special-purpose additives.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>6. For the purpose of heading 40.04, the expression &quot;waste,  parings and scrap&quot; means rubber waste, parings and scrap from the  manufacture or working of rubber and rubber goods definitely not usable as such  because of cutting-up, wear or other reasons.</p>
    <p>7. Thread wholly of vulcanised rubber, of which any cross-sectional  dimension exceeds 5 mm, is to be classified as strip, rods or profile shapes,  of heading 40.08.</p>
    <p>8. Heading 40.10 includes conveyor or transmission belts or  belting of textile fabric impregnated, coated, covered or laminated with rubber  or made from textile yarn or cord impregnated, coated, covered or sheathed with  rubber.</p>
    <p>9. In headings 40.01, 40.02, 40.03, 40.05 and 40.08, the  expressions &quot;plates&quot;, &quot;sheets&quot; and &quot;strip&quot; apply  only to plates, sheets and strip and to blocks of regular geometric shape,  uncut or simply cut to rectangular (including square) shape, whether or not having  the character of articles and whether or not printed or otherwise surface-worked,  but not otherwise cut to shape or further worked.</p>
