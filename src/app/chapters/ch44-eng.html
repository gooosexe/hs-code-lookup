    <h2>Notes.</h2>
    <p>1. This Chapter does not cover:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
      <li>(a) Wood, in chips, in shavings, crushed, ground or  powdered, of a kind used primarily in perfumery, in pharmacy, or for  insecticidal, fungicidal or similar purposes (heading 12.11);</li>
      <li>(b) Bamboos or other materials of a woody nature of a  kind used primarily for plaiting, in the rough, whether or not split, sawn lengthwise  or cut to length (heading 14.01);</li>
      <li>(c) Wood, in chips, in  shavings, ground or powdered, of a kind used primarily in dyeing or in tanning  (heading 14.04);</li>
      <li>(d) Activated charcoal  (heading 38.02);</li>
      <li>(e) Articles of heading  42.02;</li>
      <li>(f) Goods of Chapter 46;</li>
      <li>(g) Footwear or parts thereof  of Chapter 64;</li>
      <li>(h) Goods of Chapter 66 (for  example, umbrellas and walking-sticks and parts thereof);</li>
      <li>(ij) Goods of heading 68.08;</li>
      <li>(k) Imitation jewellery of  heading 71.17;</li>
      <li>(l) Goods of Section XVI or Section XVII (for example,  machine parts, cases, covers, cabinets for machines and apparatus and  wheelwrights' wares);</li>
      <li>(m) Goods of Section XVIII  (for example, clock cases and musical instruments and parts thereof);</li>
      <li>(n) Parts of firearms  (heading 93.05);</li>
      <li>(o) Articles of Chapter 94 (for example, furniture, luminaires and lighting fittings prefabricated buildings); </li>
      <li>(p) Articles of Chapter 95  (for example, toys, games, sports requisites);</li>
      <li>(q) Articles of Chapter 96 (for example, smoking pipes  and parts thereof, buttons, pencils) excluding bodies and handles, of wood, for  articles of heading 96.03; or</li>
      <li>(r) Articles of Chapter 97  (for example, works of art).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>2. In this Chapter, the expression &quot;densified  wood&quot; means wood which has been subjected to chemical or physical  treatment (being, in the case of layers bonded together, treatment in excess of  that needed to ensure a good bond), and which has thereby acquired increased  density or hardness together with improved mechanical strength or resistance to  chemical or electrical agencies.</p>
    <p>3. Headings 44.14 to 44.21 apply to articles of the  respective descriptions of particle board or similar board, fibreboard,  laminated wood or densified wood as they apply to such articles of wood.</p>
    <p>4. Products of heading 44.10, 44.11 or 44.12 may be  worked to form the shapes provided for in respect of the goods of heading  44.09, curved, corrugated, perforated, cut or formed to shapes other than  square or rectangular or submitted to any other operation provided it does not  give them the character of articles of other headings.</p>
    <p>5. Heading 44.17 does not apply to tools in which the  blade, working edge, working surface or other working part is formed by any of  the materials specified in Note 1 to Chapter 82.</p>
    <p>6. Subject to Note 1 above and except where the context  otherwise requires, any reference to &quot;wood&quot; in a heading of this  Chapter applies also to bamboos and other materials of a woody nature.</p>
    <h2>Subheading Notes.</h2>
    <p>1. For the purposes of subheading 4401.31, the expression “wood pellets” means by-products such as cutter shavings, sawdust  or chips, of the mechanical wood processing industry, furniture- making industry or other wood transformation activities, which have been agglomerated either directly by compression or by the addition of a binder in a proportion not exceeding 3% by weight. Such pellets are cylindrical, with a diameter not exceeding 25 mm and a length not exceeding 100 mm.</p>
	<p>2. For the purposes of subheading 4401.32, the expression “wood briquettes” means by-products  such as cutter shavings,  sawdust or chips, of the mechanical wood processing industry, furniture  making or other wood transformation activities, which have been agglomerated either directly by compression or by addition of a binder in a proportion not exceeding 3% by weight. Such briquettes are in the form of cubiform, polyhedral or cylindrical units with the minimum cross- sectional dimension greater than 25 mm.</p>
	<p>3. For the purposes of subheading 4407.13, “S-P-F” refers to wood sourced from mixed stands of spruce, pine and fir where the  proportion of each species varies and is unknown.</p>
	<p>4. For the purposes of subheading 4407.14, “Hem-fir” refers to wood sourced from mixed stands of Western hemlock and fir  where the proportion of each species varies and is unknown.</p>

    <h2>Statistical Notes </h2>

<p>(NB These notes do not form part of the <cite>Customs Tariff legislation</cite>.)</p>

    <p>1. For the statistical purposes of classification Nos.  4401.21.00.00 and 4401.22.00.00, the unit of measure (tonne) refers to oven dry  weight of wood in chips or particles.</p>
<p>If oven dry weight is not given, convert the number of  &quot;units&quot; shown into oven dry metric tonnes by using the following  factors:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
<li>(a) West Coast softwood units: multiply by 0.861</li>
<li>(b) Other areas softwood units: multiply by 0.726</li>
<li>(c) Hardwood units: multiply by 1.04<br>
OR</li>
<li>(d) Bone dry weight units: multiply by 1.09</li>
<li>(e) Wet weight units: multiply by 0.45<br><br>
The &quot;unit&quot; is the common quantity term used in  the industry and is defined as 200 cubic feet of uncompacted pulpwood chips,  wet or dry.</li>
</ul>
