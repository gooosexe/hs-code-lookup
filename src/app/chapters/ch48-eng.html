    <h2>Notes.</h2>
    <p>1. For the purposes of this Chapter, except where the context  otherwise requires, a reference to &quot;paper&quot; includes references to  paperboard (irrespective of thickness or weight per m²).</p>
    <p>2. This Chapter does not cover:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
      <li>(a) Articles of Chapter 30;</li>
      <li>(b) Stamping foils of heading 32.12;</li>

      <li>(o) Articles of heading 92.09;</li>
      <li>(p) Articles of Chapter 95 (for example, toys, games, sports requisites); or</li>
      <li>(q) Articles of Chapter 96 (for example, buttons, sanitary towels (pads) and tampons, napkins (diapers) and napkin liners).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>3. Subject to the provisions of Note 7, headings 48.01 to 48.05 include paper and paperboard which have been subjected to calendering, super-calendering, glazing or similar finishing, false water-marking or surface sizing, and also  paper, paperboard, cellulose wadding and webs of cellulose fibres, coloured or  marbled throughout the mass by any method. Except where heading 48.03 otherwise  requires, these headings do not apply to paper, paperboard, cellulose wadding or webs of cellulose fibres which have been otherwise processed.</p>
    <p>4. In  this Chapter the expression "newsprint" means uncoated paper of a kind used for the printing of newspapers, of which not less than 50 % by weight of the total fibre content consists of wood fibres obtained by a mechanical or chemi-mechanical process, unsized or very lightly sized, having a surface roughness Parker Print Surf (1 MPa) on each side exceeding 2.5 micrometres (microns),  weighing not less than 40 g/m² and not more than 65 g/m², and applies only to paper:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
      <li>(a) in strips or rolls of a width exceeding 28 cm; or </li>
      <li>(b) in rectangular (including square) sheets with one side exceeding 28 cm and the other side  exceeding 15 cm in the unfolded state.
      </li>
    </ul>
	
	
<p>5. For the purposes of heading 48.02, the expressions &quot;paper and paperboard, of a kind used for writing, printing or other graphic purposes&quot; and &quot;non perforated punch-cards and punch tape  paper&quot; mean paper and paperboard made mainly from bleached pulp or from pulp obtained by a mechanical or chemi-mechanical process and satisfying any of the following criteria:</p>

    </ul>

    <p>Heading 48.02 does not, however, cover filter paper or  paperboard (including tea-bag paper) or felt paper or paperboard.</p>
    <p>6. In this Chapter &quot;kraft paper and paperboard&quot; means  paper and paperboard of which not less than 80% by weight of the total fibre  content consists of fibres obtained by the chemical sulphate or soda processes.</p>
    <p>7. Except where the terms of the headings otherwise require,  paper, paperboard, cellulose wadding and webs of cellulose fibres answering to  a description in two or more of the headings 48.01 to 48.11 are to be  classified under that one of such headings which occurs last in numerical order  in the Nomenclature.</p>
    <p>8. Headings 48.03 to 48.09 apply only to paper, paperboard, cellulose wadding and webs of cellulose fibres:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
      <li>(a) in strips or rolls of a width exceeding 36 cm; or</li>
      <li>(b) in rectangular (including square) sheets with one side exceeding 36 cm and the other side exceeding 15 cm in the unfolded state.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>9. For the purpose of heading 48.14, the expression  &quot;wallpaper and similar wall coverings&quot; applies only to:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
      <li>(a) Paper in rolls, of a width of not less than 45 cm and not  more than 160 cm, suitable for wall or ceiling decoration:

      <li>(c) Wall coverings of paper made up of several panels, in rolls  or sheets, printed so as to make up a scene, design or motif when applied to a  wall.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Products on a base of paper or paperboard, suitable for use both  as floor coverings and as wall coverings, are to be classified in heading  48.23.</p>
    <p>10. Heading 48.20 does not cover loose sheets or cards, cut to  size, whether or not printed, embossed or perforated.</p>
    <p>11. Heading 48.23 applies, <em>inter alia</em>, to perforated  paper or paperboard cards for Jacquard or similar machines and paper lace.</p>
    <p>12. Except for the goods of heading 48.14 or 48.21, paper, paperboard, cellulose wadding and articles thereof, printed with  motifs, characters or pictorial representations, which are not merely subsidiary to the primary use of the goods, fall in Chapter 49.</p>

    <p>4. Subheading 4805.12 covers paper, in rolls, made mainly of  straw pulp obtained by a combination of  mechanical and chemical pulping processes, weighing 130&nbsp;g/m² or  more, and having a CMT 30 (Corrugated Medium Test with 30 minutes of  conditioning) crush resistance exceeding 1.4 newtons/g/m² at 50% relative  humidity, at 23°C.</p>
    <p>5. Subheadings 4805.24 and 4805.25 cover paper and paperboard  made wholly or mainly of pulp of recovered (waste and scrap) paper or  paperboard.
