    <h2>Notes.</h2>
    <p>1. This Chapter does not cover:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
      <li>(a) Goods of heading 32.07 (for example, vitrifiable enamels and  glazes, glass frit, other glass in the form of powder, granules or flakes);</li>
      <li>(b) Articles of Chapter 71 (for example, imitation jewellery);</li>
      <li>(c) Optical fibre cables of heading 85.44, electrical insulators  (heading 85.46) or fittings of insulating material of heading 85.47;</li>
      <li>(d) Front windscreens (windshields), rear windows and other windows, framed, for vehicles of Chapters 86 to 88;</li> 
      <li>(e) Front windscreens (windshields), rear windows and other windows, whether or not framed, incorporating heating devices  or other electrical or electronic devices, for vehicles of Chapters 86 to 88;</li> 
      <li>(f) Optical fibres, optically worked optical elements, hypodermic syringes, artificial eyes, thermometers, barometers,  hydrometers or other articles of Chapter 90;</li> 
      <li>(g) Luminaires and lighting fittings, illuminated signs, illuminated name-plates or the like, having a permanently fixed light  source, or parts thereof of heading 94.05;</li> 
      <li>(h) Toys, games, sports requisites, Christmas tree ornaments or other articles of Chapter 95 (excluding glass eyes without  mechanisms for dolls or for other articles of Chapter 95); or</li> 
      <li>(ij) Buttons, fitted vacuum flasks, scent or similar sprays or other articles of Chapter 96.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>2. For the purpose of headings 70.03, 70.04 and 70.05:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
      <li>(a) glass is not regarded as &quot;worked&quot; by reason of any  process it has undergone before annealing;</li>
      <li>(b) cutting to shape does not affect the classification of glass  in sheets;</li>
      <li>(c) the expression &quot;absorbent or reflecting or  non-reflecting layer&quot; means a microscopically thin coating of metal or of  a chemical compound (for example, metal oxide) which absorbs, for example,  infra-red light or improves the reflecting qualities of the glass while still  allowing it to retain a degree of transparency or translucency; or which  prevents light from being reflected on the surface of the glass.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>3. The products referred to in heading 70.06 remain classified in  that heading whether or not they have the character of articles.</p>
    <p>4. For the purpose of heading 70.19, the expression &quot;glass  wool&quot; means:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
      <li>(a) Mineral wools with a silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>) content not  less than 60% by weight;</li>
      <li>(b) Mineral wools with a silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>) content less  than 60% but with an alkaline oxide (K<sub>2</sub>O or Na<sub>2</sub>O) content  exceeding 5% by weight or a boric oxide (B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) content  exceeding 2% by weight.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Mineral wools which do not comply with the above specifications  fall in heading 68.06.</p>
    <p>5. Throughout the Nomenclature, the expression &quot;glass&quot;  includes fused quartz and other fused silica.</p>
    <h2>Subheading  Note.</h2>
    <p>1. For the purpose of subheadings 7013.22, 7013.33, 7013.41 and  7013.91, the expression &quot;lead crystal&quot; means only glass having a  minimum lead monoxide (PbO) content by weight of 24%.   		</p>
    <h2>Statistical Note. </h2>
    <p>(NB This note does not form part of the <cite>Customs Tariff</cite> legislation.)</p>
    <p>1.	For the statistical purposes of classification Nos. 7013.22.00.10, 7013.41.00.20 and 7013.49.00.30, the description “subject to custom duty based on excise duty” means the items classified within these classification numbers contain an excisable good such as alcohol or tobacco, when being imported.</p>
