		<p><a href="/trade-commerce/tariff-tarif/2025/01-99/ch87-2025-eng.pdf">PDF (672 KB)</a>&nbsp;[<a href="/help-aide/dimf-dodf-eng.html">help with PDF files</a>]</p>
    <h2>Notes.</h2>
    <p>1. This Chapter does not cover railway or tramway rolling-stock  designed solely for running on rails.</p>
    <p>2. For the purpose of this Chapter, &quot;tractors&quot; means  vehicles constructed essentially for hauling or pushing another vehicle,  appliance or load, whether or not they contain subsidiary provision for the  transport, in connection with the main use of the tractor, of tools, seeds,  fertilizers or other goods.</p>
    <p>Machines and working  tools designed for fitting to tractors of heading 87.01 as interchangeable  equipment remain classified in their respective headings even if presented with  the tractor, and whether or not mounted on it.<br />
      <br />
      3. Motor chassis fitted with cabs fall in headings 87.02 to  87.04, and not in heading 87.06.</p>
    <p>4. Heading 87.12 includes all children's bicycles. Other  children's cycles fall in heading 95.03. </p>

<h2>Subheading Note.</h2>

<p>1. Subheading 8708.22 covers:</p> 
<ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
	<li>(a) front windscreens (windshields), rear windows and other windows, framed; and</li>
	<li>(b) front windscreens (windshields), rear windows and other windows, whether or not framed, incorporating heating devices  or other electrical or electronic devices, when suitable for use solely or principally with the motor vehicles of headings 87.01 to 87.05.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Statistical Notes</h2>

<p>(NB These notes do not form part of the <cite>Customs Tariff legislation</cite>.)</p>

<p>1.	Road tractors, trailers and semi-trailers remain separately classified in headings 87.01 and 87.16, respectively, even when presented together.</p>

<p>2.	The classification of trailers with permanently built-on machinery is determined according to the essential character of the machinery and not to trailers of heading 87.16.</p>
