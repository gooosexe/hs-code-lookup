</ul>	

<p>Separately presented units of an automatic data processing machine are to be classified in heading 84.71. However, keyboards, X-Y co-ordinate input devices and disk storage units which satisfy the conditions of paragraphs (C) (ii) and (C) (iii) above, are in all cases to be classified as units of heading 84.71.</p>

<p>(D)	Heading 84.71 does not cover the following when presented separately, even if they meet all of the conditions set forth in  Note 6 (C) above:</p>
