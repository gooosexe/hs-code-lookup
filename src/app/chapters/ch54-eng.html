    <h2>Notes.</h2>
    <p>1. Throughout the Nomenclature, the term &quot;man-made fibres&quot; means staple fibres and filaments of organic polymers produced by  manufacturing processes, either:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
      <li>(a) By polymerisation of organic monomers to produce polymers  such as polyamides, polyesters, polyolefins or polyurethanes, or by chemical  modification of polymers produced by this process (for example, poly(vinyl  alcohol) prepared by the hydrolysis of poly(vinyl acetate)); or</li>
      <li>(b) By dissolution or chemical treatment of natural organic  polymers (for example, cellulose) to produce polymers such as cuprammonium  rayon (cupro) or viscose rayon, or by chemical modification of natural organic  polymers (for example, cellulose, casein and other proteins, or alginic acid),  to produce polymers such as cellulose acetate or alginates.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The terms &quot;synthetic&quot; and &quot;artificial&quot;, used  in relation to fibres, mean: synthetic: fibres as defined at (a); artificial: fibres  as defined at (b). Strip and the like of heading 54.04 or 54.05 are not  considered to be man-made fibres.</p>
    <p>The terms &quot;man-made&quot;, &quot;synthetic&quot; and  &quot;artificial&quot; shall have the same meanings when used in relation to  &quot;textile materials&quot;.</p>
    <p>2. Headings 54.02 and 54.03 do not apply to synthetic or  artificial filament tow of Chapter 55.</p>
